## Prompt

/sp.adr Implementation-Approach-for-Futuristic-Homepage

## Response snapshot

Created an Architecture Decision Record (ADR-0003) for the frontend technology stack for the futuristic homepage. The ADR documents the decision to use Docusaurus v3+, TypeScript 5.3+, GSAP 3.12+, React 18+, and associated testing libraries. The decision was made to support advanced animations, accessibility compliance, and responsive design while maintaining technical rigor. The ADR includes positive and negative consequences, alternatives considered, and references to related documentation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive ADR documenting the frontend technology stack decision with alternatives and tradeoffs
- 🧪 Tests: No specific tests added in this session
- 📁 Files: Created ADR file at history/adr/0003-frontend-technology-stack-for-futuristic-homepage.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Task complete, no further prompts needed for this operation
- 🧠 Reflection: The ADR provides clear documentation of the technology stack decision with proper justification and alternatives
