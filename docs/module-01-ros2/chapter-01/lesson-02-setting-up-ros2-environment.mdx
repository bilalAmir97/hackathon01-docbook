# Setting Up Your ROS 2 Environment

## Learning Objectives

- Install ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill on your system
- Configure the ROS 2 environment variables
- Verify the installation with basic commands
- Understand the ROS 2 workspace structure

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (recommended) or compatible Linux distribution
- Basic command-line knowledge
- Administrative privileges for installation

## Installing ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill

ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill is the latest Long Term Support (LTS) release, providing stability and long-term support for robotics development.

### System Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) - Recommended
- 64-bit x86 processor (ARM64 also supported)
- At least 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- At least 10GB free disk space

### Installation Steps

1. **Set up your sources list**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg lsb-release
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
   ```

2. **Add the repository to your sources list**

   ```bash
   echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(source /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
   ```

3. **Install ROS 2 packages**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
   ```

4. **Install additional development tools**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
   sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator
   ```

5. **Initialize rosdep**

   ```bash
   sudo rosdep init
   rosdep update
   ```

### Environment Setup

After installation, you need to source the ROS 2 setup script. Add this line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Creating a ROS 2 Workspace

A workspace is a directory where you modify and build ROS 2 packages. Let's create one:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws
```

### Building the Workspace

```bash
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

## Verifying Installation

Test that ROS 2 is properly installed by running:

```bash
ros2 --help
```

You should see a list of available ROS 2 commands.

### Running a Simple Test

1. **Open a new terminal** and source your ROS 2 environment:

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   ```

2. **Run a simple talker node**:

   ```bash
   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
   ```

3. **In another terminal**, source the environment and run a listener:

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
   ```

You should see the talker publishing messages and the listener receiving them.

## Common Environment Variables

ROS 2 uses several environment variables to configure its behavior:

- `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`: Defines the communication domain (default: 0)
- `ROS_LOG_DIR`: Directory for log files
- `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION`: Specifies the RMW (ROS Middleware) implementation

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Permission Errors

If you encounter permission errors, ensure your user is in the correct groups:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

### Package Not Found

If packages are not found, make sure you've sourced the correct setup file:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

## Key Takeaways

- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill provides LTS support for robotics development
- Proper environment setup is crucial for ROS 2 to function correctly
- Workspaces organize your custom ROS 2 packages
- Verification steps ensure installation success

## Next Steps

Now that your environment is set up, the next lesson will cover basic ROS 2 command-line tools that you'll use regularly in your robotics development workflow.
