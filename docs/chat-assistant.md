# AI Chat Assistant

The documentation includes an AI-powered chat assistant that can answer questions about ROS 2, robotics, and the course content.

## Getting Started

### Opening the Chat

Look for the **chat button** in the bottom-right corner of any page. Click it to open the chat panel.

### Asking Questions

1. Type your question in the text box at the bottom of the chat panel
2. Press **Enter** or click the **Send** button
3. Wait for the AI to respond

**Example questions:**
- "What is ROS 2?"
- "How do I create a ROS 2 node?"
- "Explain the publisher-subscriber pattern"

## Features

### General Questions

Ask any question about the documentation content. The AI will search the book and provide relevant answers with citations.

### Ask About Selected Text

Want to ask about a specific passage?

1. **Select text** by clicking and dragging on any page
2. A small **"Ask about this"** button will appear near your selection
3. Click the button to open the chat with your selection loaded
4. Ask your question - the AI will answer based specifically on that text

### Citations

Every AI response includes **citations** showing where the information came from:
