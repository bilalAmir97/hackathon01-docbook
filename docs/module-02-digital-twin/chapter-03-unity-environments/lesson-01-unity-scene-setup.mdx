# Lesson 1: Unity Scene Setup for Robotics

This lesson covers configuring Unity scenes with lighting and camera systems for robot visualization.

## Unity Scene Configuration

Setting up Unity for robotics visualization requires:
- Proper lighting setup for realistic rendering
- Camera systems for different viewing angles
- Performance optimization for real-time visualization

## Coordinate System Considerations

Unity uses a different coordinate system than Gazebo:
- Unity: Left-handed (X right, Y up, Z forward)
- Gazebo: Right-handed (X forward, Y left, Z up)
- Transformations must account for these differences
