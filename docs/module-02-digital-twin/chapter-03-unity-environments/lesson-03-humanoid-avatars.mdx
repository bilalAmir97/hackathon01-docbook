# Lesson 3: Humanoid Avatars and Interaction

This lesson covers creating humanoid avatars and implementing interaction visualization in Unity.

## Humanoid Avatar Creation

Creating effective humanoid avatars involves:
- Proper mesh and rigging for realistic movement
- Material and texture setup for visual fidelity
- Animation system configuration for joint movements
- Collision and trigger setup for interaction detection

## Visualization Techniques

For robot interaction visualization:
- Trail effects for movement paths
- Highlighting systems for selected components
- Debug visualization for sensor data
- Status indicators for robot state
