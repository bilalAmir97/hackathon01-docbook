# Lesson 2: Lighting and Rendering for Robot Evaluation

This lesson covers implementing realistic lighting and rendering techniques for robot evaluation in Unity.

## Lighting Techniques

Effective lighting for robotics visualization includes:
- Directional lights for simulating sunlight
- Point lights for localized illumination
- Real-time shadows for depth perception
- Reflection probes for environmental reflections

## Rendering Optimization

For real-time robotics visualization:
- Use appropriate shader complexity
- Optimize draw calls and batching
- Implement level of detail (LOD) systems
- Consider occlusion culling for complex scenes
