# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the ROS 2 Robotics Education curriculum. This module focuses on creating digital twins that connect physics simulation in Gazebo Garden with high-fidelity visualization in Unity, specifically for humanoid robotics applications.

## Overview

This module covers the complete pipeline for developing digital twin systems that bridge simulation and reality for humanoid robots. You'll learn how to:

- Set up the development environment with ROS 2 Humble, Gazebo Garden, and Unity
- Create physics-accurate simulations in Gazebo
- Develop high-fidelity visualizations in Unity
- Integrate sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs) in simulation
- Bridge sim-to-real considerations and best practices

## Module Structure

This module is organized into several chapters, each focusing on specific aspects of digital twin development:

### [Setup Guide](./setup/)
Complete setup guide for configuring your development environment with ROS 2, Gazebo, and Unity.

### [Chapter 1: Foundations](./chapter-01-foundations/)
Introduction to digital twin concepts, ROS 2 integration, and establishing the digital twin pipeline.

### [Chapter 2: Gazebo Physics](./chapter-02-gazebo-physics/)
Creating physics simulations in Gazebo Garden with proper gravity, collision, and humanoid interaction.

### [Chapter 3: Unity Environments](./chapter-03-unity-environments/)
High-fidelity visualization environments in Unity for robot evaluation and human-robot interaction.

### [Chapter 4: Simulated Sensors](./chapter-04-simulated-sensors/)
Implementing and configuring virtual sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs) for perception in simulation.

### [Chapter 5: Bridging Sim to Real](./chapter-05-sim-to-real/)
Considerations and best practices for transferring systems from simulation to real-world deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- A working development environment with ROS 2 Humble, Gazebo Garden, and Unity
- Familiarity with Linux command line and Git

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Create comprehensive digital twin systems for humanoid robotics
- Integrate physics simulation with high-fidelity visualization
- Implement sensor simulation with realistic characteristics
- Apply sim-to-real transfer techniques and best practices
- Validate digital twin functionality for real-world deployment

Begin with the [Setup Guide](./setup/) to configure your development environment, then proceed through each chapter in order for the complete learning experience.
