# Chapter 4: Simulated Sensors

Welcome to Chapter 4 of the Digital Twin module, where we'll explore how to implement and configure virtual sensors for your humanoid robot in the Gazebo simulation environment.

## Overview

In this chapter, you'll learn how to:
- Implement LiDAR sensors for 2D mapping and obstacle detection
- Configure depth cameras for 3D perception and object recognition
- Set up IMU sensors for orientation and motion tracking
- Visualize sensor data in both Gazebo and Unity environments
- Integrate sensor data with ROS 2 for robot perception

## Lessons

1. **[LiDAR Simulation](./lesson-01-lidar-simulation.mdx)**: Learn to configure LiDAR sensors with realistic parameters and noise models
2. **[Depth Camera Simulation](./lesson-02-depth-camera-simulation.mdx)**: Implement RGB-D cameras with point cloud generation capabilities
3. **[IMU Simulation](./lesson-03-imu-simulation.mdx)**: Set up inertial measurement units for orientation and motion sensing

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:
- Completed Chapter 1-3 of this module
- A working Gazebo Garden installation
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Your humanoid robot model configured in URDF

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Configure realistic sensor models in Gazebo
- Integrate sensors with ROS 2 communication
- Visualize sensor data in Unity
- Validate sensor performance in simulation

Let's begin with implementing LiDAR sensors in the next lesson.
