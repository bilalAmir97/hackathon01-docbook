# Lesson 1: Setting up Gazebo for Physics Simulation

This lesson covers the setup and configuration of Gazebo Garden for physics simulation of humanoid robots.

## Gazebo Installation and Configuration

Gazebo Garden (Ignition) provides advanced physics simulation capabilities:
- Realistic physics engine with configurable parameters
- Support for complex robot models and environments
- Integration with ROS 2 for communication

## Basic World Configuration

Creating a basic Gazebo world involves:
- Defining the physics engine parameters
- Setting up the environment with ground plane and lighting
- Configuring simulation time and step size
