# Lesson 3: Humanoid-Environment Interaction

This lesson covers implementing collision detection and response for humanoid robots in Gazebo physics simulation.

## Collision Detection

Collision detection in Gazebo involves:
- Defining collision geometries for robot links
- Setting up contact sensors to detect interactions
- Configuring collision properties and response

## Physical Properties

Humanoid robot models require:
- Appropriate mass distribution across links
- Correct inertial properties for realistic movement
- Proper joint limits and constraints
