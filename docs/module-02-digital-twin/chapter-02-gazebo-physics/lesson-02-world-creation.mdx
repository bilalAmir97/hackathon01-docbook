# Lesson 2: Creating Worlds with Gravity and Collisions

This lesson covers creating Gazebo worlds with configurable physics parameters including gravity, friction, and collision detection.

## Physics Parameters

Key physics parameters in Gazebo include:
- Gravity: The acceleration due to gravity (typically -9.8 m/s²)
- Friction: Coefficients that determine how objects interact when in contact
- Damping: Parameters that reduce motion over time

## SDF World Files

Simulation Description Format (SDF) files define:
- World geometry and physics properties
- Robot models and their placement
- Environment features and lighting
