# Lesson 2: ROS 2 Integration for Digital Twins

ROS 2 serves as the communication backbone for digital twin systems, enabling seamless data exchange between simulation and physical systems.

## ROS 2 in Digital Twins

ROS 2 provides several key capabilities for digital twin implementations:
- Message passing between simulation and real systems
- Service calls for configuration and control
- Action-based communication for long-running processes
- Parameter management for system configuration

## Bridge Architecture

The bridge architecture connects:
- Gazebo simulation environment
- Unity visualization environment
- Physical robot systems
- User interfaces and monitoring tools
