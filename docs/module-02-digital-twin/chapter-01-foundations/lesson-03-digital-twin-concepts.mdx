# Lesson 3: Establishing the Digital Twin Pipeline

The digital twin pipeline is the core infrastructure that enables real-time synchronization between Gazebo simulation and Unity visualization environments.

## Pipeline Components

The digital twin pipeline consists of:
- Data publishers in Gazebo environment
- ROS 2 bridge for message transmission
- Data subscribers in Unity environment
- Synchronization validation mechanisms

## Coordinate System Mapping

Proper coordinate system mapping is essential:
- Gazebo uses a right-handed coordinate system (X forward, Y left, Z up)
- Unity uses a left-handed coordinate system (X right, Y up, Z forward)
- Transformations must account for these differences
