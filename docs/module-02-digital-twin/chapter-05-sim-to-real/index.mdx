# Chapter 5: Bridging Sim to Real

Welcome to Chapter 5 of the Digital Twin module, where we'll explore the critical considerations for bridging the gap between simulation and real-world robotics applications.

## Overview

In this chapter, you'll learn about:
- The fundamental limitations of simulation environments
- Key considerations for successful sim-to-real transfer
- Best practices for developing effective digital twin systems
- Strategies for maintaining accuracy and reliability in digital twins

## Lessons

1. **[Limitations of Simulation](./lesson-01-limitations.mdx)**: Understanding the fundamental differences between simulated and real environments
2. **[Transfer Considerations](./lesson-02-transfer-considerations.mdx)**: Key strategies for successful sim-to-real transfer
3. **[Best Practices for Digital Twins](./lesson-03-best-practices.mdx)**: Essential practices for developing and maintaining effective digital twin systems

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:
- Completed Chapters 1-4 of this module
- A solid understanding of Gazebo Garden and Unity integration
- Experience with ROS 2 concepts and integration
- Familiarity with sensor simulation from Chapter 4

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Identify and address key limitations of simulation environments
- Implement strategies for successful sim-to-real transfer
- Apply best practices for developing effective digital twin systems
- Evaluate the readiness of simulated systems for real-world deployment

Let's begin by examining the fundamental limitations of simulation environments in the next lesson.
