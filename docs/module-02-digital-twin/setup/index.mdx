# Digital Twin Module Setup Guide

Welcome to the setup guide for the Digital Twin module. This section provides comprehensive instructions for configuring your development environment to work with ROS 2 Humble, Gazebo Garden, and Unity for digital twin applications.

## Setup Topics

1. **[Environment Setup](./environment-setup.mdx)**: Configure your development environment with ROS 2 Humble, Gazebo Garden, and Unity 2022.3 LTS

2. **[ROS-Gazebo Bridge Setup](./ros-gz-bridge-setup.mdx)**: Install and verify the ros_gz bridge packages for Gazebo integration

3. **[Basic Humanoid URDF Model](./basic-humanoid-urdf.mdx)**: Create a basic URDF model for a humanoid robot that works in both Gazebo and Unity

4. **[Version Control Setup](./version-control-setup.mdx)**: Set up version control for simulation assets (URDF, SDF, Unity scenes)

## Getting Started

Follow these guides in order to properly set up your development environment for the Digital Twin module. Each guide builds upon the previous one, providing a complete foundation for your simulation work.

After completing the setup, you'll be ready to work with the digital twin pipeline connecting Gazebo physics simulation and Unity visualization environments.
